# Portfolio: C# School Tasks
In a rare and rather lucky occurrence, we got a few classes a week with an actual software developer, breaking through the usual low quality "education" by those who have no idea what even AJAX is, and so naturally could not get a job literally anywhere else.

We approached these tasks like an actual software developer team would, with planning involving everybody in the class. After that, we were set to try to complete the task on our own.

Bored, I decided to do the task, but unlike my classmates, implementing the layer system, as well as writing readable and maintainable code. Thus, this is a code quality showcase. Code reusability was already demonstrated - Task 1 (Csempebolt) was used to build Task 2 (Autokolcsonzo).

Similar code quality applies to the current version of [CuteCat](https://benedani.xyz/cutecat/), which remains closed source for now due to lack of interest.

# About portfolio repositories
These repositories were meant to demonstrate how I write software, and to be able to say that I have a GitHub portfolio.

I plan to contribute to open source as well (in particular, eyeing a [certain Nintendo Switch emulator](https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx/) as well as Linux projects) - but financial stability has to come first. Without eggs, no chickens will be able to hatch.
